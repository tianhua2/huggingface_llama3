# ProPainter

## Overview

The ProPainter model was proposed in [ProPainter: Improving Propagation and Transformer for Video Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03897) by Shangchen Zhou, Chongyi Li, Kelvin C.K. Chan, Chen Change Loy.

ProPainter is an advanced framework designed for video frame editing, leveraging flow-based propagation and spatiotemporal transformers to achieve seamless inpainting and other sophisticated video manipulation tasks. ProPainter offers three key features for video editing:
a. **Object Removal**: Remove unwanted object(s) from a video
b. **Video Completion**: Fill in missing parts of a masked video with contextually relevant content
c. **Video Outpainting**: Expand the view of a video to include additional surrounding content

ProPainter includes three essential components: recurrent flow completion, dual-domain propagation, and mask-guided sparse Transformer. Initially, we utilize an efficient recurrent flow completion network to restore corrupted flow fields. We then perform propagation in both image and feature domains, which are jointly optimized. This combined approach allows us to capture correspondences from both global and local temporal frames, leading to more accurate and effective propagation. Finally, the mask-guided sparse Transformer blocks refine the propagated features using spatiotemporal attention, employing a sparse strategy that processes only a subset of tokens. This improves efficiency and reduces memory usage while preserving performance.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Flow-based propagation and spatiotemporal Transformer are two mainstream mechanisms in video inpainting (VI). Despite the effectiveness of these components, they still suffer from some limitations that affect their performance. Previous propagation-based approaches are performed separately either in the image or feature domain. Global image propagation isolated from learning may cause spatial misalignment due to inaccurate optical flow. Moreover, memory or computational constraints limit the temporal range of feature propagation and video Transformer, preventing exploration of correspondence information from distant frames. To address these issues, we propose an improved framework, called ProPainter, which involves enhanced ProPagation and an efficient Transformer. Specifically, we introduce dual-domain propagation that combines the advantages of image and feature warping, exploiting global correspondences reliably. We also propose a mask-guided sparse video Transformer, which achieves high efficiency by discarding unnecessary and redundant tokens. With these components, ProPainter outperforms prior arts by a large margin of 1.46 dB in PSNR while maintaining appealing efficiency.*

This model was contributed by [ruffy369](https://huggingface.co/ruffy369). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/sczhou/ProPainter). The pre-trained checkpoints can be found on the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models?sort=downloads&search=ruffy369%2Fpropainter).

## Usage tips:

- The model is used for both video inpainting and video outpainting. To switch between modes, you need to provide a value of a `tuple(h,w)` to the `scale_hw` keyword argument in the `ProPainterVideoProcessor`. In the usage example, we have demonstrated both ways of providing video frames and their corresponding masks regardless of whether the data is in `.mp4`, `.jpg`, or any other image/video format.

- After downloading the original checkpoints from [here](https://github.com/sczhou/ProPainter/releases/tag/v0.1.0), you can convert them using the **conversion script** available at
`src/transformers/models/propainter/convert_propainter_to_hf.py` with the following command:

```bash
python src/transformers/models/propainter/convert_propainter_to_hf.py \
    --pytorch-dump-folder-path /output/path --verify-logits
```

- You must remember this while providing the inputs as a single batch (one video), i.e., if the size of a single frame goes lower than 128 (height or width) then you may possibly encounter the error below. The solution is to keep the frame size to a minimum of **128**.

For debugging consider passing CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1.
Compile with `TORCH_USE_CUDA_DSA` to enable device-side assertions.

## Usage example

The model can accept videos frames and their corresponding masks frame(s) as input. Here's an example code for inference:

```python

        indices (`List[int]`): List of frame indices to decode.
    Returns:

    '''
    frames = []
    container.seek(0)

    end_index = indices[-1]
    for i, frame in enumerate(container.decode(video=0)):
        if i > end_index:
            break
        if i >= start_index and i in indices:
            frames.append(frame)
    return np.stack([x.to_ndarray(format="rgb24") for x in frames])

    '''
    converted_len = int(clip_len * frame_sample_rate)
    end_idx = np.random.randint(converted_len, seg_len)
    start_idx = end_idx - converted_len
    indices = np.linspace(start_idx, end_idx, num=clip_len)
