    "past_key_values": r"""
    Pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention
    blocks) that can be used to speed up sequential decoding. This typically consists in the `past_key_values`
    returned by the model at a previous stage of decoding, when `use_cache=True` or `config.use_cache=True`.

    Two formats are allowed:
    - a `~cache_utils.Cache` instance, see our
    [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache);
    - Tuple of `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)` of length `config.n_layers`, with each tuple having 2 tensors of
    shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, embed_size_per_head)`). This is also known as the legacy
    cache format.

    The model will output the same cache format that is fed as input. If no `past_key_values` are passed, the
    legacy cache format will be returned.

    If `past_key_values` are used, the user can optionally input only the last `input_ids` (those that don't
    have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, 1)` instead of all `input_ids`
    of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.

    Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This

    model's internal embedding lookup matrix.

    The LLaMa Model transformer with a sequence classification head on top (linear layer).

    [`LlamaForSequenceClassification`] uses the last token in order to do the classification, as other causal models

    Since it does classification on the last token, it requires to know the position of the last token. If a
    `pad_token_id` is defined in the configuration, it finds the last token that is not a padding token in each row. If
    no `pad_token_id` is defined, it simply takes the last value in each row of the batch. Since it cannot guess the
    padding tokens when `inputs_embeds` are passed instead of `input_ids`, it does the same (take the last value in
    each row of the batch).

    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads

    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
    and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`LlamaConfig`]):
            Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not
